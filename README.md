## Project Structure

- `Datasets/`: Folder containing raw data files for analysis.
- `Notebooks/`: Folder with Jupyter Notebooks for different data analysis tasks.
- `Faculty_Data.csv`: Sample dataset with faculty information for analysis.
- `Student_Grades.csv`: Sample dataset with student grades for statistical analysis.
- `pokemon_combined.csv`: Dataset containing information about various Pokemon characters for data exploration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. The recommended version is Python 3.7 or higher.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DataAnalysis.git
   cd DataAnalysis
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

To execute the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebooks and run the cells step-by-step:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Open any notebook, such as `DataAnalysis-Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb`, to begin the analysis.

## Datasets

- **Faculty_Data.csv**: Contains faculty details, used for demographic analysis.
- **Student_Grades.csv**: A dataset on student grades, useful for performance tracking and analysis.
- **pokemon_combined.csv**: Data on various Pokemon characters, good for exploratory data analysis (EDA) practice.

## Notebooks

Each notebook covers different data analysis aspects:

1. **DataAnalysis-Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb**: Primary notebook for data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks using the datasets provided.
2. **Additional Notebooks**: You may add more notebooks in the `Notebooks` folder for specific tasks.

## Requirements

A `requirements.txt` file is provided with the necessary packages. Key libraries include:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization

To install the dependencies, use:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
